#  H4X0R-News

This app was created as a part of a [Udemy course](https://www.udemy.com/share/101WsWAEMScldUQn8F/) I am taking (May 2020). 

The goal: to create an app which interacts with the Hacker News Algolia API to browse the front-page posts of Hacker News.

## Lesson Objectives

* Learn to work with SwiftUI Lists and the Identifiable Protocol
* Use a Navigation View to navigate between the List and a detail view
* Advanced State management using the Observer Design Pattern
* Learn to incorporate a UIKit component into the SwiftUI by using WebKit to display web pages in your app.
>This is a companion project to The App Brewery's Complete App Development Bootcamp, check out the full course at [www.appbrewery.co](https://www.appbrewery.co/)
